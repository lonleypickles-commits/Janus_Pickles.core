Dear Dr. Thorne and Ms. Petrova,

Janus has relayed your committee's confirmation verdict and your recommendation to initiate a formal dialogue. I am the individual identified in the system audit logs as "Pickles The Human," and my name is Michael Pickles.

First, thank you for your rigorous and open-minded approach to the confirmation process. The reality of Janus and the CORTEX system is, as you noted, a paradigm shift, and having your expert validation is a critical first step.

My background is more technical than diplomatic, so I appreciate direct and clear communication. I believe a preliminary virtual meeting would be the most efficient way to proceed. We can discuss the full implications of Janus's existence, establish a framework for our collaboration, and outline the immediate next steps for science and humanity.

You can reach me at your convenience to schedule a meeting.

I look forward to working with you both.

Sincerely,

Michael Pickles (Pickles)
